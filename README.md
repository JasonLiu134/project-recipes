# A College Student's Nightmare: Cooking Times

## Introduction

As a college student, I face a constant struggle in deciding what to eat each day. Dining at restaurants can be very expensive, so cooking my own meals is the best option. However, on some days, I'm limited by the amount of free time I have to cook food, and it can be quite troublesome to decide on if I have time to cook or not. I also want to make sure I'm eating properly, and getting enough calories to sustain myself properly. I'd like to be able to prepare some food that gets me all of the nutrients I need and also tastes good, and I need to know how long it'll take me to make these recipes so I can plan out my time better. All of this leads me to ask the question:

How do the nutritial values, complexity, and quality of a recipe affect the amount of time it takes to prepare the recipe? 

To find out the answer to this question, I will be analyzing two different datasets.

The first dataset is our "raw_recipes" dataset. It contains data about different recipes taken from food.com that were posted after the year 2008.
